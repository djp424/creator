# Creator
A program that creates programs

# Timer
Another thing the base template programs do is give you a good way to time your code.

# Setup
Add an alias to your .bash_profile to copy templates over.

## Alias Examples with Atom
alias cpy='cp /Users/dparsons/Code/creator/templates/base.py .; atom .'

Note: Make sure to update your .bash_profile with "source ~/.bash_profile" when making changes
